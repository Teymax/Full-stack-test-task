### Getting Started with React

[What is React?](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-is-react)

### UI framework

We don't want you to build your own UI components but instead use a framework.  
Our Wunderbox uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/overview/) to build the interface for the CMS.  
Take a look at which components the framework offers and choose whichever you need.

### Development

We used [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to set up the environment.

After installing all dependencies, you can run

```bash
$ npm run start
# or
$ yarn start
```

to start development with automatic browser-reloading after changes to the src-folder.
