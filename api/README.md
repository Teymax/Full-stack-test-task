### Getting Started with Express

[What is Express?](https://expressjs.com/)

### Development

Install current dependencies.

We added a npm script for local development:

```bash
$ npm run dev
# or
$ yarn dev
```

It uses [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to watch for changes in the src-folder and restart the node-app if needed.
