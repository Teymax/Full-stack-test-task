# Fullstack-Candidate-Task

Your task is to build a small tool that converts one currency into another.

We prepared the repository so that you can start right away.  
`ui` folder for the frontend- and `api` folder  for the backend-code.  

Use [React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#what-is-react) in combination with the [Ant Design](https://ant.design) UI framework to easily set up the user-facing part of the tool.  
The frontend should communicate with the nodejs backend using a REST API. There is a basic express-app inside the `api` folder â€“ feel free to use it or switch to any other framework you personally prefer.

You need to use any open API to load the currency-data for selected currencies.

If there is time, add tests for your frontend- and backend-code.
